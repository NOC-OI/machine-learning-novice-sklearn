## Other algorithms

There are many other machine learning algorithms that might be suitable for helping you to answer your research questions.

The Scikit-Learn [webpage](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) has a good overview of all the features available in the library.

## Genetic algorithms

Genetic algorithms are techniques which try to mimic biological evolution. They will learn to solve a problem through a gradual process
of simulated evolution. Each generation is mutated slightly and then evaluated with a fitness function. The fittest "genes" will then be selected
for the next generation. Sometimes this is combined with neural networks to change the networks size structure.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44) shows a genetic algorithm evolving neural networks to play a video game.
